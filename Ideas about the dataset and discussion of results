Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

Only basic preprocessing techniques were applied to this dataset. Some ideas for feature engineering that could enhance the dataset include adding a series to the dataframe that is the increase/decrease from the day before, or adding columns that contain the day of the week or month. 

Ideas for the dataset

The two models I trained performed quite badly. This application was difficult for me, as I have absolutely no background in statistics. 

However, I found a method from sklearn that could possibly be applied: TimeSeriesSplit. Because of the limited documentation, I did not attempt its implementation, but it seems similar to the approach that Dr. K. mentioned in class that is similar to cross validation but for Time Series data. 

Additionally, if I had more experience with statistics and programming, I would try applying ARIMA and a recurrent neural network to the dataset.
